<h1>Offensive Security</h1>

* Offensive Security refers to proactive strategies used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications.
* It involves simulating attacks to understand potential weaknesses, often through penetration testing, ethical hacking, and red teaming. The goal is to strengthen defenses before malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities.
